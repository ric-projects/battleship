# Battleship 

## Basic battleship game using Vanilla JavaScript to reinforce TDD practices (Test Driven Development)

A very simple interface due to main focus being on the implemented logic and modularity of the project, tests were developed for the Ship class while avoiding tighly coupled classes.
Jest was used for tests, Webpack for bundling and Babel as a dependency requirement of Jest.

Instructions:
- ``npm install`` for installing dependencies (webpack, jest, globals, eslint, babel, html loader and prettier)
- ``npm run dev`` to host it locally with Hot Reloading enabled
